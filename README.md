# sortify
Implementing sorting algorithms for JavaScript made easy.

## Instalation
Just include sortify.js (or minified version) to your html document.
```html
<script src="path/to/sortify.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

## Usage
You must access the ```sortify``` object, and provide a method name with an argument. An argument must be an array.
Example:
```javascript
sortify.bubble([1, 5, 6, 89, 21]);
//outputs [1, 5, 6, 89, 21]
```
